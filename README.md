# DSA-Programs

Welcome to the **DSA-Programs** repository! üéâ This repository contains implementations of **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** for various data structures, primarily written in **C programming language**. It serves as a learning resource and a practical guide for mastering data structures and algorithms.

## üå≥ What‚Äôs Inside?

This repository is organized into directories, each representing a core concept or category in data structures and algorithms. Here's a quick overview:

| **Directory**    | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Linked List`    | Implementations of single, double, and circular linked lists with operations.   |
| `Stack`          | Stack implementations using arrays and linked lists, including common problems. |
| `Trees`          | Comprehensive programs for tree data structures like BST, AVL, and binary trees.|
| `TUF`            | Code implementations inspired by "Take U Forward" tutorials.                   |
| `notes`          | Notes and explanations related to DSA concepts.                                |
| `patterns`       | Programs for common patterns in programming (e.g., stars, pyramids).           |
| `python code`    | Python implementations for additional DSA problems.                            |
| `sorting`        | Algorithms for sorting, including quicksort, mergesort, and more.              |

## üîß Example Usage

Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started with running the C programs:

### **Running a C Program**
1. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `Trees/`).
2. Compile the program using a C compiler like `gcc`.  
   ```bash
   gcc AVL.c -o AVL

Run the compiled program.

```./AVL            ```
